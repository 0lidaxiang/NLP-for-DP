美國名導昆汀塔倫堤諾執導、李奧納多狄卡皮歐主演的新片《決殺令》日前於中國上映，
然而卻傳出首場僅放映1分鐘，所有放映戲院卻突然宣布因「技術問題」停映。中共審查
制度嚴格眾所皆知，特別是暴力、色情，以及觸及共產黨敏感政治議題的情節，決殺令
三者皆有，但令人不解的是，審查機關既然已經審查並刪修過，為何又在電影都開始上映
後才緊急喊卡？

主持人同時也談到了布萊德彼特的新片WORLD WAR Z，以及鋼鐵人3在中國放映時的不同版

英文簡介：

Django Rechained | NTD China Uncensored

Django Unchained was supposed to open in China this week, but at the last
minute, theaters got the word they had to pull it. Cancelled because of
"technical issues." China has some pretty strict censorship and most Western
movies get edited before they can be played in China. They cut excessive
violence, nudity, and politically sensitive issues. Django basically has all
three. But censors had supposedly already looked at it. So why promote the
movie, only to pull it at the last minute?

On this episode of China Uncensored, Chris Chappell looks at what Hollywood
has been doing to self-censor so they can access the world's fastest growing
movie market. From Brad Pitt's World War Z and Robert Downy Jr's Iron Man 3.
