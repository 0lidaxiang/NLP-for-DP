Billy’s girlfriend Natalie, who has no chemistry whatsoever with Billy and
ends up just sort of fading off screen with no resolution at all.  What was
truly terrible about her character though is the arc that involves Billy
finding out that the indie film she just starred in features a graphic, fully
nude sex scene with her attractive male co-star.  Not only does she not tell
Billy about this, but she waits until the public premiere of the film for him
to find out and then acts like he’s being the unreasonable one.

This is where the movie goes from mediocre to incomprehensible mess.  The
plot is confusing as hell, not because of complexity but because of poor
explanation of what’s actually going on.

這個梗
鋪得有點莫名其妙...
